# Javascript
- [Min value = min range] Validate histogram bounds: check what kind of data we get about ranges
   - [YES] Is the lowest element the minimum the field can have? 
   - if so then update the HistogramChart correctly
- Correlation: it's valuable to show it
- n_distinct, avg_width, elem_count_histogram?

# Ruby
- Avoid activerecord, connect and destroy connections
- Add devise + set up encryption for db
- Sql analyzer, or explain explanation
