- Correlation: it's valuable to show it
- n_distinct, avg_width, elem_count_histogram?
- Charts for values with commas in them
- Histogram chart does not seem to work for specific data types (mostly strings)
- Histogram chart needs tooltip to be showing the range the percentage is for (e.g. 0 - 10000)
- Check Histogram chart for tables with a lot of repetitions (e.g. engine name) to see if the chart correctly represents the distribution of data
- Sql parser and showing the data related to fields used
- select an area to see the percentages
- show indexes, show number of rows and percentages

# Ruby
